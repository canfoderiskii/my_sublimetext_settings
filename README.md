# my_sublimetext_settings
My sublime text settings for Windows

The files in this repo can be placed anywhere. Before opening editor, use the 
`setup.bat` to create directory junctions that makes the plugins and their 
settings portable.

Not directly creating `Data` folder inside the root of Sublime Text so that I 
don't have to copy the cache folder and editor itself when I copy back and forth
between different computers some of which are not connected to Internet.
